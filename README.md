# Add heading and other minor syntax highlights to Google Docs based on the LaTeX content

What's supported:

- Turning \section, \subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph into headings
- Add gray color to tables
- Add gray color to notes

# Installation

You can install it on the Docs you are using, it's not a global add-on like the ones in the store:

- Go to tools, Script Editor
- Paste the content of the .js file into the editor
- Save, close the editor
- In the document, click Add-ons / LaTeX Syntax Highlight, which will format the whole document
- Note: it is worth cutting and re-pasting the whole document without formatting first
